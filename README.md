This an app I built using <a href="https://github.com/dmuth/splunk-lab">Splunk Lab</a>
to extract data from AWS S3 Server Access Logs and use that data for graphs and analysis.


## Getting your AWS S3 Server Access Logs

You'll need to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html">configure Server Access Logging in AWS S3</a>. Once that's done, you can either
pull down many small logfiles directly, or instead perform daily rollup on them
<a href="https://github.com/dmuth/aws-s3-server-access-logging-rollup">with an AWS S3 Rollup app</a> which I built specifically for this purpose.

Either way, you can use the `aws` CLI app to download all of your logs into `logs/` 
directory and then concatenate the contents of each directory into a single file for that bucket with something like this:

- `aws s3 sync s3://my-accesslogs/rollup-day/ logs`
- `cd logs/`
- `for DIR in $(find . -type d); do cat $DIR/* > $DIR.txt; done`
- `for DIR in $(find . -type d); do rm -rfv $DIR/* > $DIR.txt; done`

Naturally, this is highly dependent on how you're storing logs.


## Starting up Splunk Lab

Next, start up Splunk Lab with this command:

- `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmuth/splunk-lab/master/go.sh)`

The script will guide you through various settings you can send to Splunk Lab.

From there, you can go to <a href="https://localhost:8000/">https://localhost:8000</a>,
log into Splunk with the credentials you specified when starting it, and you should be
able to search for data or view reports in dashbaords.


## Known Issues


### Q: I see an error about exceeding "the configured depth_limit"?

A: You'll need to increase that value in `app/limits.conf`. You can <a href="https://answers.splunk.com/answers/661864/regex-data-parsing-using-delimiter-comma-has-excee.html">read more about that here</a>.
